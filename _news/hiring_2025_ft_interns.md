I am hiring a (Senior) Research Scientist (full-time) and a PhD Research Intern (6 months) @ Ping An Silicon Valley Lab. Both roles will focus on developing multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) aimed at addressing climate change challenges. [Email me](mailto:bpeng.paii@gmail.com) if you are interested.
