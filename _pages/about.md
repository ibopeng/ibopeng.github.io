I am a Senior Applied Scientist working on GenAI for Ads Measurement at Amazon. Previously, I led the research of multimodal LLMs for geospatial perception at PAII, the [Ping An U.S. Research Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/paii-inc/about/). Before that, I am with [Google[x]](https://x.company/projects/tapestry/) as an AI resident and with [Los Alamos National Lab (LANL)](https://www.lanl.gov/engage/collaboration/internships/summer-schools/applied-machine-learning-fellowship) as an Applied Machine Learning Research Fellow. I received Ph.D. (major in Geo-Information Science, minor in Machine Learning & Signal Processing) and M.Sc. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from University of Wisconsin - Madison.

My research is centered on GenAI, particularly multimodal LLMs and image generation models.
